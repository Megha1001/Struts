MVC
----------
Architectural design pattern for building any enterprise application, web application or any standalone application.

Application divides into three parts
- Model
- View - Presentation code
	- HTML
	- HTML-5
	- JSP
	- Custum Tags
	- Adobe Flex
	for providing validation support
		- Ext JS
		- JS
		- JQuery
		- AJAX
		- Boostrap
	For Styles
		- CSS
		- CSS 3
		
- Controller --> Read data coming form presentation part and send data to presentation part
	- Servlets
	- JSP
	- Filter
	- Tag

MVC-II
-----------------
- Model --> divide into three parts
	- Business
		Java code
		
		
	- DAO --> for database CRUD operation
		- JDBC
		ORM Operation -  Provide cache support also and query are not database dependent
			- EJB-E - QL -- database independent
			- Hibernate - HQL - object oriented queries --> database independent
			- JPA

	- Service
		- for rollback --> weblogic, webserver can provide transactional support
			Suppose we have one fund transfer service from account 1--> 2, while updating amt in 2 bank if it fails we need to rollback the value of amt in acct 1 also, how we can do it in business layer by using TX(Transactional Support) and our java code need to implement from  EJB session beans or else Spring
	if Using weblogic , websphere --> we need to use EJBs in business class
	or if using spring webservice -->  we need to use Spring classes in Java logic




STRUTS : Useful for controller and view part
Additionally which things we require : 
- Server side validation
- Internationlization Support : If browser user is Indian use we need to change the language
- Form backup --> submitting invalid data to server with some valid fields on submitting the form server will return error along with it should keep valid data as is only invalid it needs to delete from form (we dont have that functionality in servelets we can use JSP useBean)
- Exception handling
- Modularization : (not possible in servlets)
	100 modular classes are there and we need to share in 3 modules(30+30+40) in servelts we need to share jsp, controller and web.xml, that web.xml will be same if some other developers modify it , then it will override the config of another developer so servlets doesn't have modularization support but it is present in STRUTS.
In STRUTS we cannot access another module page but in servlets we can access it by simple URL change --> MODULE to MODULE Security
- FOr designing View pages
	- Dynamic templates - Tiles support --> dynamic changes on UI
- Webservices support : Star sports android app calls controller

THOSE ARE BUILD IN METHOD IN STRUTS


FEATURES OF STRUTS 1.x
1. form backup support
2. validation support
3. Internationalization support - > based on lanuage change browser
4. Localization support --> bases on language change business
5. Exception handling
6. Modularization
7. MUlti button /multiAction controllers
8. Tiles support --> for UI design/maintenance


Structs are upto controller layer to talk to model we have plugins support (Structs to interract with EJB/Hibernate)

FEATURES in STRUCT 2.x
9. AJAX
10. webservices support
11. annonation support
12. OGNL support --> for designing UI pages
13. Interceptors
14. Pull MVC --> pull any data from controller part

Struts --> 3rd party framework given by Apache framework
